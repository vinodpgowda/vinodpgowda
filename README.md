# 👋 Hi, I'm Vinod Kumar Puttamadegowda

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I am a Software Engineer specializing in backend development with a strong focus on Large Language Models (LLMs), Generative AI, databases, and cloud technologies. My expertise lies in building scalable, efficient, and secure applications, with hands-on experience in applying LLM-driven AI solutions to real-world software engineering challenges.

## 🚀 Featured Projects

### 🧩 [AI-Driven Expense 8 Puzzle Solver](https://github.com/vinodpgowda/AI-driven-expense-8-puzzle-solver)
An intelligent solver for a modified 8-puzzle problem, leveraging **AI search algorithms** like A*, BFS, and UCS to find cost-efficient solutions. This project demonstrates state-space exploration and heuristic-driven problem solving.

### 🤖 [AI Agent for Red-Blue Nim](https://github.com/vinodpgowda/game-playing-problem)
A game-playing AI agent for the Red-Blue Nim game, implemented using **Minimax with Alpha-Beta Pruning**. Features optimal decision-making strategies for both standard and misère game variations.

### ✍️ [LLM - Detect AI Generated Text](https://github.com/vinodpgowda/LLM-Detect-AI-Generated-Text)
A machine learning model to classify text as either AI-generated by **Large Language Models (LLMs)** or written by humans. Combines **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques with probabilistic modeling for authorship detection.

### 🌐 [Portfolio Website](https://github.com/vinodpgowda/portfolio)
A personal portfolio website showcasing my projects and professional journey. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it features a modern, responsive design with links to my work and contact information.

### 📊 [Metropolitan City Transportation Database System](https://github.com/vinodpgowda/arlington-sprouts-store)
A **Neo4j-based graph database** project designed to manage city transportation data. Highlights include optimized queries, NoSQL design, and efficient data visualization.
